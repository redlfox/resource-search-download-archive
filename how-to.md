#####  First aid is bad idea

First aid is bad because it tests everything as a logical issue and tries to fix it, rather than verifying the drive physical health first, and only doing finest repairs on a drive proven to be healthy.

The only way at a DIY level is to clone the drive using ddrescue or hddsuperclone under Linux, then scanning the clone with R-Studio (as one good option, there are other good choices) and saving the data onto another drive. You cannot use a USB interface to connect the drive.
