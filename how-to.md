# How to

## Access Websites: Basics
* Simulate desktop or mobile device
* Change your user agent

firefox chrome

some websites are tolerant to search engine crawlers, so use one like Googlebot may can let you access websites that blocking you. This is a Example of Niconico: [geo-block & User-Agent spoofing](https://mmaker.moe/2025/01/niconico-geo-block-user-agent-spoofing/)
* delete site cookies and data.
* Change your access client

browser
headless browser
crawler

* Change your access ip
* Be aware clicking links. Use the inspector to check links on page. Be careful if you have to click a button.
* **Nerver disable the ad blocker on untrusted pages!**
## My Comments
I suggest you to learn a scripting language like python because you can use it to process crawled data and modify tools written in the same language for your purpose.

* switch between http and https protocols.
* delete the subdomain in hostname of the address.
* use direct ip address of the website.
* try another ports.

use nmap to scan open ports of a website server.
* delete or add something in the path of the address.

For example, you can access the directory of a file if the website does't block it.

## Ask for help

[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
Don't know what to do? Have some difficult problems? But you can always ask someone to help.
I recommend going to [Archiveteam IRC channels](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Archiveteam:IRC). You can get high quality responses. But you shouldn't ask to many simple questions. It's not positive for your problem-solving because you need to solve problems youself to learn. And it is a waste of other people's time.
