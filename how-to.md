## Ask for help

Don't know what to do? Have some difficult problems? But you can always ask someone to help.
I recommend going to [Archiveteam IRC channels](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Archiveteam:IRC). You can get high quality responses. But you shouldn't ask to many simple questions. It's not positive for your problem-solving because you need to learn to solve problems and is a waste of other people's time.
